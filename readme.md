# PAD Experiment Series

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks designed to explore different aspects of predictive analytics and decision-making. These experiments are aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of hypothesis testing, model selection, and confusion matrix analysis within the context of machine learning and data science.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. `PAD_Exp1_HypothesisTesting.ipynb`
This notebook focuses on hypothesis testing techniques for validating assumptions in data analysis. It covers:
- Null and alternative hypotheses
- Statistical significance testing
- Implementation of key tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests)
- Practical examples using synthetic or real-world datasets

### 2. `PAD_Exp2_ModelSelection.ipynb`
The second notebook dives into model selection methodologies to identify the best-performing predictive models. It includes:
- Comparing multiple machine learning algorithms
- Cross-validation techniques
- Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search, random search)
- Performance evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)

### 3. `PAD_Exp3_ConfusionMatrixAnalysis.ipynb`
This notebook provides a detailed analysis of confusion matrices to assess classification models. Key topics covered are:
- Construction and interpretation of confusion matrices
- Calculating performance metrics (e.g., F1 score, specificity, sensitivity)
- Visualizing confusion matrices for better insights

## Requirements

To run these notebooks, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
